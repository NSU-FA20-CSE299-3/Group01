<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>I am going to build an app specially for faculty members. Where a faculty can manage his students data. A faculty is a very busy person so I think this app will help them to manage their students. They can keep track of their student’s data. They will be able to update data on regular basis. 
There will be a lot of database. A database to keep Faculty’s username and password to login. And a database to keep students data like F.name, L.name, Id, PhoneNo, etc. And a database to keep data on regular basis like exam’s marks. 
At the start of a semester a faculty member will be given a section on his particular subject. In a section there will be 40 students. And throughout the semester the faculty have to upload regular data like Quiz-I marks, Quiz-II marks, MID marks, Project marks, Final Marks. At the end of the table there will be a column for total marks and Final Grade. Grade will be on a university’s grading policy (ex- North South University).</p>

<p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>	Easy to handle the app.</li>
<li>	Able to install in low end devices( at least android lollipop 5.0)</li>
<li>	Easy presentation to understand</li>
<li>	Easy Log-in process to take shorter time </li>
<li>	FAQ on every activity if anything is not understandable. </li>
<li>	A menu activity to manage sections properly</li>
<li>	An activity to view students data</li>
<li>	A mark sheet activity to update exam’s mark regularly</li>
<li>	An activity to watch student’s progress on total marks</li>
<li>	Students can be searched by ID to see their progress</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<p>I will build this Android app on Android Studio 4.0.1. The latest version for android developers to build android apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Frontend</em></p>
<p>Basically in applications there are User Interface. They called activity. Where users can watch the main purpose of an application. There will be multiple activity. Users will go through them with pressing some buttons or inputs. I will design these activities with android studio. It will be .xml file.</p>
<p><em>Backend</em></p>
<p>Basically in applications backend means where the logics are working. I will connect the activities with intents. I will use JAVA on the maximum part and maybe if needed I will use C/C++ in some portion of the backend. And it will be .java file.</p>
<p><em>Database</em></p>
<p>Here database will be created in the main coding. Database will hold the data of students and faculty members.</p>
<p><em>Server</em></p>
<p>If I use online database then I have to purchase space to hold the data and connect users with the database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monetization</strong></p>
<p>This is actually a customized project not a generic project. This type of project held for particular organization. </p>
<p>My application basically is on educational purpose. So, I have to charge an amount of money to an educational organization like North South University who will use this app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Social Impact</strong></p>
<p>This application will help the faculty or teachers. They are very busy to manage their student’s data properly. They don’t have enough time to do a lot of works properly at a time. They will be able to sort out the marks of students and don’t need to waste their time to calculate the final grade.</p>
